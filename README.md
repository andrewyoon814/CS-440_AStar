# CS440_AStar
A simple A* search  implementation in Prof. Rahul Shome's CS440 Intro to AI class.

All use of this code must be consistent with the [DCS Academic Integrity Policy.] (https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academic-integrity/introduction)

We were given two maze files that we had to read in and parse. #'s represented obstacles and .'s represent free spaces.
We were given the start and goal and told to print out our steps to an output file.

My solution matched the professor's solution in the number of steps in took to reach the goal!


maze_No_1, start point is (1,1) and goal is (78,47).

maze_No_2, start point is (101,101) and goal is (1,53).
